# Simple Anagram Maker

A simple one-word anagram generator for Python 3, created using no external libraries.

Type in the letters you wish to check. If it's possible for one or more single word anagram from those letters, then they will be printed to the screen.

Try using the letters: apres, aelrts and aerst to see a longer list of anagrams. Use a question mark (?) for a wildcard letter.
